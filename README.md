# üß™ Analysis of Soil Health Compliance with Agronomic Standards

This repository presents a data-driven assessment of soil health by analyzing various physical, chemical, and biological soil parameters and evaluating their compliance with standard agronomic benchmarks. The project aims to support sustainable land management and precision agriculture by identifying nutrient deficiencies, soil imbalances, or potential risks to crop productivity.

The analysis utilizes real or simulated soil test data, applying descriptive statistics, visualizations, and threshold-based evaluations to determine whether soil samples meet agronomic standards for essential factors such as pH, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), organic matter content, electrical conductivity, and others.

## üìå Objectives

* Assess the quality of soil samples against agronomic benchmarks.
* Identify soil health issues such as nutrient imbalance or acidity.
* Provide actionable insights for soil improvement and crop planning.
* Promote evidence-based recommendations for sustainable farming.
